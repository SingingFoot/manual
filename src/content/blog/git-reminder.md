### Initialize a repository

To initialize an existing repository enter the following command inside the repository.

```
git init
```

To create a new folder and initialize a new repository inside it enter the following command into the terminal. The new folder will be created inside the current folder.

```
git init <new folder name>
```

### Check the current status of your repository

Get a list of all the files inside your repository

```
ls
```

Get a level up from your repository

```
cd ..
```

Check the status of your repository

```
git status
```

### Unstage files or discard changes

To unstage a file:

```
git reset HEAD <file_name>
```
To unstage only one previous change:

```
get reset HEAD^1
```
or to unstage a file:
```
git restore --staged <file-name>
```

To discard changes:

```
git restore <file_name>
```
or
```
git checkout --<file_name>
```

### Rename or move files

Rename a file in Git:

```
git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>
```

Move a file in other folder.

**âš  NOTE: File and folder must be in one folder.** 

```
git mv <file_name> <target_folder_name>
```

### Create file

Create an empty file

```
touch <file_name>
```

Create a file with some text inside

```
echo <text> >> <file_name>
```

### Delete a file or a folder

Delete a file

```
rm <file_name>
```

Delete a folder

```
rm -rf <folder_name>
```

### Get the story of your commits

```
git log
```

To get all the commits history in one line:

```
git log --oneline
```

To get decorated onliner commit history:

```
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

To exit from the **Story of commits** mode press "q". 

To get all the commits of a specific file:

```
git log --<file_name>
```

### Find difference between commits

Find difference between an arbitrary and the last commit:

```
git diff <arbitrary_commit_number> HEAD
```

### Work with branches

Check your existing branches first

```
git branch -a
```

Create a new branch

```
git branch my_new_branch
```

Switch to a new branch

```
git checkout my_new_branch
```

Create a new branch and switch to it simultaneously

```
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
```

Rename your branch:

```
git branch -m <old_name_branch> <new_name_branch>
```

Delete your branch:

```
git branch -d <name_of_your_branch>
```

Merge your side branch into main branch. You must be on your main branch for that.

```
git merge <name_of_your_branch>
```

Merge your branch with "no fast-forward" flag to clearly see the branch in log

```
git merge --no-ff
```

### Rebase process

Rebase your branch

```
git rebase <branch_name>
```

If you have changes made in both local and global branches simultaneosly, then use such commands

```
git fetch

git pull --rebase
```
