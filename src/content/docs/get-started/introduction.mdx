## Briefly and generally

<img src="/blogpics/digital_me.jpg" width="250" align="left" style="margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px"/>

I began my career in technical writing as the author of five fiction books, a journalist, and an automation and instrumentation engineer.

I have a university postgraduate diploma in translation & interpreting. I've been using English for practical purposes for the past 15 years, and I'm proud to say that I have a C1 (advanced)-C2 (proficient) level of proficiency according to the CEFR guidelines, meaning I have full working proficiency.

I have more than 6 years of experience in technical writing, working with software, hardware, gadget engineering, and IoT companies. In addition to that, I bring over 20 years of expertise in journalism and creative writing. I've also spent a decade honing my skills in video and audio production. To top it off, I have 4 years of experience in automation unit management.

Now, let's dive into my skills. I'm well-versed in API documentation, utilizing tools like Swagger, Stoplight, and Rapid. I also have experience with API collections and manual testing using Postman. When it comes to static website generators, I'm proficient in Astro, MkDocs, Hugo, Docusaurus (Markdown), Sphinx (reStructuredText), Gatsby, Hexo, and Jekyll.

My expertise extends to CI/CD and Docs-as-Code workflows with GitHub, and I have a strong command of Markdown. I'm familiar with various style guides such as Google, Microsoft, Vocab, Write Good, and I use linter Vale and Visual Studio Code to ensure high-quality writing. In terms of authoring, I'm skilled in RoboHelp and Framemaker, and I'm quite comfortable working with Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

When it comes to design, I'm proficient in tools like Figma, Miro, Draw.io, Google Slides, Adobe Photoshop, Audition, After Effects, Premiere, and Illustrator. I also have experience using UML with PlantUML and Terraform Docs. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, and possess basic knowledge of Java, JavaScript, and Python.

In my professional toolkit, I utilize Atlassian Confluence and Jira for collaboration and project management. I'm well-versed in using GitHub for version control, and I'm comfortable working with platforms like Trello and Slack for effective team communication. Microsoft Office tools like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams are second nature to me. I also have experience in localization using Smartcat, POeditor, and Poedit.

Now, let me highlight some of my career achievements. I've successfully implemented over 100 engineering methodologies, and I have extensive experience in localizing user guides and documents for developers and engineers. On the creative side, I've published 6 fiction books and 3 books on the judicial practice of Ukraine. In the realm of media production, I've created 3 documentaries and produced over 100 videos on demand. I've also hosted more than 200 radio podcasts. Lastly, I've managed 2 Facebook ad campaigns worth $2,000, which collectively reached an audience of over 1,000,000 people.
