## Using Visual Studio Code for Technical Writing
Now that your VS Code environment is set up, let's explore some features and workflows that can improve your technical writing process:

Open a Markdown file, press Ctrl+Shift+V (or Cmd+Shift+V on macOS) to open the preview, and see how your Markdown content looks in real-time.

- Integrated Terminal: Utilize the integrated terminal within VS Code to run commands or scripts related to your documentation. Press Ctrl+Backtick (or Cmd+Backtick on macOS) to open the terminal.

- Snippets and Code Templates: Create custom snippets or use existing ones to quickly insert frequently used code snippets, templates, or boilerplate text. This feature can save time and improve consistency in your documentation. To access snippets, go to File > Preferences > User Snippets and select the relevant language.

- Collaborative Editing: VS Code allows collaborative editing, making it easy to collaborate with other team members on documentation. Use Live Share (an extension) to share your workspace with others, enabling real-time collaboration, code review, and discussion.
