## Code documentation 

| Configuration | Code | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **Type Definition** | /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */ | The configuration file is annotated with a JSDoc comment specifying the type of the configuration object as per Tailwind CSS standards (`import('tailwindcss').Config`). |
| **Module Export** | `module.exports = {` | The configuration object is exported using `module.exports`, making it accessible to other parts of the application. |
| **Content Paths** | `content: ['./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}'],` | The `content` key specifies the paths where Tailwind will scan for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other file types. In this configuration, it includes files with extensions such as `.astro`, `.html`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.md`, `.mdx`, `.svelte`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.vue` within the `./src` directory and its subdirectories. |
| **Theme Extensions** | `theme: { extend: {}, },` | The `theme` key allows extending or customizing the default theme provided by Tailwind CSS. The `extend` property is an empty object `{}`, indicating that no additional theme extensions are provided in this configuration. |
| **Safelist** | `safelist: ['dark:!text-white'],` | The `safelist` key specifies classes that should not be purged by Tailwind CSS during production builds. Here, the `safelist` includes the class `dark:!text-white`, ensuring that the 'dark' variant of the 'text-white' utility is not purged. |
| **Plugins** | `plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],` | The `plugins` key includes additional plugins to enhance Tailwind CSS functionality. In this configuration, the `tailwindcss-typography` plugin is added using `require('@tailwindcss/typography')`, providing improved typography support. |

## Explanation 

This configuration file serves to customize the behavior and appearance of Tailwind CSS within a project. It specifies the content paths where Tailwind will look for files to process, any theme extensions or customizations, classes that should be excluded from the purging process, and additional plugins for enhanced functionality.
